For our semester-end project, we have created a web application to manage portfolios of stocks. Here are some of its features:

2. Login/Logout
3. Quote - allows user to check stocks’ real time prices and an interactive graph which shows the closing prices for last 10 days
4. Buy - where the user can enter the stock(symbol) and quantity of shares to purchase
5. Sell - allows user to sell shares of stocks
6. History - summarizes user’s transactions
7. Change Password - feature which lets the user change password in case they forget
8. Add Cash - lets the user add extra funds to their portfolio
